# 71 Ways to Become a Better Game Designer

Based on Gabe Barrett's "Board Game Design Advice from the Best in the World" and the Board Game Design Lab community.

## Core Design Principles (The Foundation)

### 1. Know Your Customer Avatar
Who is your game for?
- How old are they?
- What's their normal day look like?
- What snacks do they eat before playing games?
- Do they have kids? Do they have 4 hours or 30 minutes?
- Do they like math?
- What kind of experience are they looking for?

**The more specific you are, the more likely you are to make a great game for that person.**

### 2. Know Your Why
Why do you want to make this game? Why is it important that it gets to people's tables?

Knowing your why will keep you motivated to finish a design. Write it down and keep it somewhere visible.

### 3. Player Experience First
**Concern yourself more with the player experience than the mechanics and theme.**

How the players feel during your game is far more important than if the game is about Cthulhu or if worker placement is your main mechanic. First, figure out what you want players to experience, and then build out your theme and mechanics to achieve that experience.

### 4. Create a Fun Engine
Players should put energy in your engine and get fun out.

Fun looks different to different people. Make sure the people playing your game are having fun. (That's what board games are truly about after all.)

### 5. Begin with the End in Mind
You don't have to know exactly how you'll get there, but at least know what you want the players to try to accomplish by game's end.

- Are they trying to escape the dungeon or defeat the demon king?
- Are they trying to build the best city or be the best at managing resources?

When you identify where you're going, it's a lot easier to actually get there.

### 6. Explain Your Game in 2 Minutes or Less
If you can't explain it in less than 2 minutes, you need to simplify your game.

This isn't about explaining the rules. It's about conveying what your game is all about—the core experience.

## Design Philosophy (How to Think)

### 7. Less Is More
Don't add something to your design just because it's cool or clever. Make sure everything in your game is necessary and adds to the experience.

### 8. Don't Add Too Many New Things
Players can only learn one or two brand new mechanisms at a time. (That's why "gateway games" exist.)

If you've got a bunch of ideas that have never been done before, don't put them in the same game.

### 9. Reuse What Works
Don't throw a bad design in the trash. Put it in the recycling bin and reuse elements that worked well.

And in the same way, don't disregard elements from a good design. Find ways to reuse and repurpose what worked. Many great designers have reused certain mechanics over and over again to great success.

### 10. Learn from Bad Design
You're going to make some bad games. You're probably going to make some REALLY bad games. Just make sure you learn from each one.

Why was it bad? Why did the playtesters absolutely hate it? Even the best designers make bad games, but they dust themselves off and keep going.

### 11. Take One Bite at a Time
When you start designing a game, especially a meaty game, it can be daunting. Just take one bite at a time. Don't get overwhelmed. Solve one problem at a time.

### 12. Fix One Thing at a Time
All new designs have problems. Lots of problems. But don't try to fix everything at once.

There's a good chance your "fixes" will actually create more problems. Be methodical in your approach.

---

## Community & Growth

### 13. Get Involved in the Community
Find a group of other designers, and get to know them. You'll be able to accomplish far more with a group than you could ever do on your own.

### 14. Get Out of the Echo Chamber
Find people who disagree with you and engage in open and honest discussion about your game and games in general. You'll be a more well-rounded designer for it.

### 15. Help Others First
You have to give before you get. Help others with their games. They'll help you with yours.

### 16. Give More Than You Take
The more you give, the more you'll receive. As with anything else in life, it's the people who are quick to help and quick to give who receive the most in the end.

### 17. Seek to Understand
Don't seek to be understood. Ask questions. Figure out why a person thinks a certain way.

Realize that listening is not just waiting for your turn to talk. Take note of what information is being shared with you.

### 18. Build an Email List
The sooner you build a list of people interested in your game the better. Email is the #1 way to market to people and the most preferred means of communication for the majority of people.

---

## Professional Conduct

### 19. Don't Get Mad If You Have an Ugly Baby
Don't get offended. Don't get defensive. Try to figure out why they don't like it. Weigh the criticism and decide what's useful.

### 20. Don't Talk Bad About Other People
Speaking poorly of publishers, reviewers, designers, or gamers reveals a great deal about your character and will cause you great harm in the gaming industry.

Board gaming is a fairly small place, so anytime you make incendiary remarks about others, it's probably going to get heard by people you would probably like to work with one day.

### 21. Don't Begrudge Publishers That Reject Your Game
There could be any number of reasons why a publisher says "no." Don't take it personally.

If the publisher is gracious enough to explain why they're not going to sign your game, listen intently. Don't try to convince them they're wrong. Learn from the experience.

### 22. Communicate Regularly
Be consistent in your communication. Consistency leads to familiarity and then leads to trust. People are more likely to buy and play your games if they trust you.

### 23. Sell Yourself
A publisher isn't just signing your game. They're also signing you. Be aware of that in all your interactions.

They don't have to sign your game. Remember that you need them more than they need you. There are a lot of great games out there. But the more a publisher likes you, the better chance you stand.

## Learning & Inspiration

### 24. Play Lots of Games!
The best way to learn what works well in games is to play great games. Play as many different great games as you can.

An author gets better by reading great books. A game designer gets better by playing great games.

### 25. Play Other People's Prototypes
You can learn a great deal about what works and what doesn't by helping people with their prototypes.

### 26. Watch Other People Playing Great Games
People will tell you everything you need to know about what they're thinking and feeling without even saying a word.

Watch their body language. Look at how engaged they are. You'll notice a huge difference when they're playing a great game compared with an okay game.

### 27. Read What Designers Have to Say
There are lots of board game blogs and game design journals. Read as much as you can to figure out how great designers think and how they approach different aspects of gaming.

### 28. Listen to What Designers Have to Say
There are lots of board game podcasts in which designers go into great detail about various topics. Listen and learn.

### 29. Watch Game Reviews
It's not possible to play all the games that come out, but you can still be familiar with the games you don't get to play through watching reviews.

See what types of games are trending. Learn about new mechanics. Figure out what makes reviewers happy.

### 30. Borrow from Other Games
Board games are where they are now because of the board games that came before them.

There are very, very few new concepts or ideas in gaming. Most great games just take ideas from the past and change them in interesting ways. Always feel free to borrow ideas from what has worked in other games.

## Tools & Habits

### 31. Keep a Design Notebook
Get a notebook that's specifically for game design. Organize it so it's easy to find what you're looking for.

It's common to write something down that you don't return to for six months.

### 32. Never Let an Idea Get Forgotten
Never leave home without a way to record an idea.

Whether it's an app on your phone or a napkin and crayon, make sure you always have a way to hold onto the ideas that pop into your head.

### 33. Schedule Your Design Time
The difference between professionals and amateurs is that the pros don't wait for inspiration to strike. They schedule when they're going to design.

What gets scheduled gets done. So, start scheduling your designing at specific times, and stick to it.

### 34. Work on Your Game Every Day
Even if it's just one tiny thing, do something toward your design every single day.

### 35. Work on One Game at a Time
Most game designers have "shiny object syndrome." Whenever they get a new idea, they jump headfirst into it and leave the game they were working on behind.

Write down the new idea, so you can come back to it later, but stay focused on the task at hand.

### 36. Or Don't...
There's also value in working on more than one game at a time. Sometimes you get stuck on one design and working on something else can help you get unstuck.

Just don't keep bouncing to new projects and never finish anything.

---

## Convention & Networking

### 37. Go to Design Conventions and Meetups
Get out of your house, and take your game with you. Meet people. Help them with their games. They'll help you with yours.

### 38. Meet People
As with any other industry, it's often about who you know. (Or more importantly, who knows you.)

The more active you are in the design community, the better chance you have of people wanting to help you.

### 39. Volunteer in Publishers' Booths
One of the best ways to get to know people is by volunteering at publishers' booths at conventions. It's mostly grunt work, but you'll get to have conversations with people in the industry.

### 40. Learn How to Demo a Game
Watch how the pros demo a game. How do they explain the rules? What methods do they use to keep players engaged? Apply what you learn to your own demoing opportunities.

### 41. Get Better at Public Speaking
If you want your game to get signed by a publisher, you're going to have to talk to them. Public speaking skills will also help you greatly when demoing your game.

---

## Testing & Iteration

### 42. Fail Fast
The more you work on a design, the faster you'll find out what works and what doesn't and the faster you can get it in front of playtesters to find out what really doesn't work.

Fail early and often. The more you fail, the more you learn. And the more you learn, the better your designs get.

### 43. Playtest Early and Often
Get your idea in front of people as quickly as possible. Change some things, and playtest again. Repeat.

### 44. Playtest Without Saying a Word
Hand players the box and step back. Watch as they go through the rules and figure the game out. Don't say anything when they play a rule wrong. See what happens.

### 45. Video the Playtest Sessions
Record your playtest sessions and go back and watch them. This allows you to focus on different things at different times. Video is the best way to analyze your game's player experience.

### 46. Use a Great Play Tester Feedback Form
Playtesting is useless if you don't capture and record it. Use a feedback form that's concise and not overwhelming.

### 47. Playtest with Different Groups
Find different types of gamers to play your game. Get differing opinions and viewpoints. Constantly put new eyes on your design.

### 48. Playtest with People Who Don't Know You
Find people who won't feel bad about tearing your game apart. These are the most valuable people in your game design process.

### 49. Listen to Playtesters
Let their voices be heard. DO NOT DEFEND YOUR GAME. Ask questions. Seek to understand.

### 50. Don't Listen to Playtesters
It's your game, so never feel like you have to change it just to make someone else happy. Weigh all criticism and only change the things you truly think need to be changed.

Listen more to why a playtester feels a certain way and less to their ideas on overhauling your design.

### 51. Playtest. Over and Over and Over Again.
The best thing you can do to become a better designer is to playtest your game over and over again. (And over and over...)

---

## Making Decisions

### 52. Know When to Walk Away
Sometimes you get to a point in a design and things are just not working out. Maybe it's gotten too convoluted or maybe playtesters just don't think it's any fun.

Sometimes you have to pull the plug and go try something else.

### 53. Kill Your Darlings
Never fall in love with an idea or mechanic to the point that you refuse to kill it. If something isn't working, get rid of it. Maybe it'll work in a different design.

### 54. Realize That Perception Is Reality
When players open your game and read your rules, you aren't going to be there to explain what you were thinking or what you were trying to do with the design.

Their perception of your design will be their reality. Design accordingly. Be clear. Be concise.

### 55. Don't Worry About the Art
Art is for the end. It's for when the game is done. For now, just go to Google images and take what you need to get your point across.

### 56. Don't Try to Figure Out the Perfect Title
Let it flow naturally. You might get 6 months into a design before you find the right title. Don't force it.

### 57. Just Ship the Thing
There's no such thing as a perfect game. If you keep tinkering and keep trying to make it perfect, it'll never get finished.

You have to know when to stop and be proud of what you've created.

## Business & Publishing

### 58. Don't Expect Anyone to Care About Your Game
Thousands upon thousands of games come out each year, all vying for attention. Don't be disappointed when people don't care about your game.

It's not their job to get excited. It's your job to excite them.

### 59. Design with Budget in Mind
A game that costs a lot to print isn't likely to get published. Keep that in mind when designing.

### 60. Don't Think Too Much About the Budget
But at the same time, don't get caught up too much on how much a game will cost to make. If your game really needs that custom component, so be it.

### 61. Don't Ask for Price Quotes Too Early
If your design isn't 90% done, you don't have any business on manufacturers' websites.

Asking for price quotes is just an easy way to feel like you're accomplishing something while you're actually just procrastinating.

### 62. Don't Do a Kickstarter Unless You Want to Start a Business
Running a Kickstarter campaign means you're starting a business and you get to deal with everything that goes along with that.

If you haven't built up a following, built up an email list, and been an active engager in the gaming community, you're probably not going to be successful.

### 63. Don't Do a Kickstarter Unless You're Fairly Certain It'll Fund
If all you're doing is "hope marketing," you're probably not going to succeed.

### 64. Don't Consider Kickstarter Unless You Want to Start a Business
Please understand that running a Kickstarter campaign means you're starting a business: Accounting. Project management. Customer service. Logistics. If you're not ready to handle all that, you're not ready to run a campaign.

### 65. Don't Spam Forums
Please don't show up to a game design forum or Facebook group just to tell everyone about your game and then expect them to care.

They won't. Please join forums. Please contribute to discussions and engage in the community. But please don't show up out of the blue, spam everyone, and then expect good things to happen.

### 66. Don't Ask for Free Services
The whole "it'll be great for your portfolio" thing is a bunch of garbage. If you aren't prepared to pay people for their services (art, graphic design, etc), you aren't actually committed to the project.

### 67. Don't Be a Cheapskate
Pay people what they're worth. Don't expect people to respect your craft if you don't respect theirs.

### 68. Make an Awesome Sell Sheet
Publishers are incredibly busy. They don't have time to listen to your 20 minute explanation. Your sell sheet is your game's first impression.

You can have an amazing game, but if your sell sheet doesn't convey that, you'll likely miss out.

### 69. Go Pro
If you want to be a serious game designer, you have to stop dabbling and only being interested. You have to commit to it. Take it seriously. Act like a professional and you'll become one.

### 70. Don't Quit Your Day Job... Yet
This is a tough industry. Don't quit your day job until you have some traction.

### 71. Niche Down
A game for everyone is really a game for no one. If you cast too broad of a net, you won't catch anything.

This is another reason why it's important to know who your customer avatar is. You'll end up with a mediocre game that's for "everyone" as opposed to having a great game that's for someone specific.

## The Golden Rule

**Concern yourself more with the player experience than the mechanics and theme.**

Everything else flows from this. If you focus on creating an amazing experience for your players, the mechanics and theme will naturally follow.
