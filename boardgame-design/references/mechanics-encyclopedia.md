## How to Use This Encyclopedia

1. **When designing:** Browse categories for inspiration. Combine mechanics in new ways.
2. **When analyzing:** Identify which mechanics a game uses and how they interact.
3. **When problem-solving:** If something isn't working, look for alternative mechanics in the same category.
4. **When brainstorming:** Pick two random mechanics and design a game that uses both.

---

## Design Exercise

1. Pick one mechanism from each of 3 different categories
2. Design a simple game that uses all three
3. Evaluate using the 5-Component Filter
4. Iterate based on playtesting

**Example:** Action Points (ACT-01) + Area Majority (ARC-02) + Push-Your-Luck (UNC-02)

---

## Remember

**Mechanics are tools, not goals.** The goal is to create a meaningful player experience. Choose mechanics that serve that experience.
