# The 5-Component Filter: Full Rubric

For significant features, evaluate each component across four dimensions.

## Clarity (Rules & State Visibility)

| Dimension | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Signals** | Rulebook clarity, component icons, status indicators, terminology consistency, visual hierarchy |
| **Rules** | How rules are written, examples provided, edge cases covered, FAQ sections |
| **Knobs** | Font size, icon design, color coding, layout density, rulebook organization |
| **Acceptance Test** | Can new players learn rules from the rulebook in under 15 minutes? Can experienced players resolve disputes without designer intervention? |

### Clarity Red Flags
- Rulebook uses the same term for different concepts
- Rulebook uses different terms for the same concept
- No examples provided for complex interactions
- Components look too similar (e.g., resource cubes vs. damage cubes)
- Critical information hidden in small print or footnotes
- Rules reference other rules without page numbers

### Clarity Best Practices
- **Glossary:** Define all game terms in one place
- **Visual icons:** Use icons alongside text on components
- **Turn overview:** Show a complete turn structure on one page/panel
- **Examples:** Include at least one illustrated example per major mechanic
- **Edge cases:** Address common "what if" scenarios explicitly
- **FAQ:** Anticipate and answer frequently asked questions

## Strategy (Meaningful Decisions)

| Dimension | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Signals** | Multiple viable paths to victory, trade-offs between choices, short vs. long-term decisions |
| **Rules** | How decisions compound, consequences of choices, risk/reward mechanics |
| **Knobs** | Number of options per turn, depth of decision trees, consequence magnitude, information availability |
| **Acceptance Test** | Do players have at least one non-obvious decision each turn? Can skilled players consistently outperform novices? |

### Strategy Red Flags
- One choice is clearly dominant
- Randomness outweighs decision-making
- First player always wins
- Perfect information leads to solvable games
- Analysis paralysis (too many equally good options)
- No meaningful player agency

### Strategy Best Practices
- **Trade-offs:** Every choice should have pros and cons
- **Multiple paths:** 2-4 viable strategies to victory
- **Skill ceiling:** Experts should outperform novices
- **Consequences:** Decisions should matter beyond the current turn
- **Information balance:** Hidden vs. open information creates interesting dynamics
- **Snowball vs. catch-up:** Balance early advantages with comeback mechanics

## Interaction (Player Engagement)

| Dimension | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Signals** | Direct conflict, trading systems, shared resources, information exchange, turn-order competition |
| **Rules** | How players affect each other, restrictions on interaction, timing of interference |
| **Knobs** | Frequency of interaction, impact magnitude, attack/defend ratios, trading constraints |
| **Acceptance Test** | Are players ever bored during others' turns? Does each player's actions affect others? |

### Interaction Red Flags
- Multiplayer solitaire (players might as well be playing alone)
- Kingmaker problem (one player decides who wins without winning themselves)
- Player elimination (eliminated players wait with nothing to do)
- Zero interaction (direct conflict games only)
- Forced interaction (co-op games with no individual agency)
- Take-that dominates strategy (interactions feel punitive, not strategic)

### Interaction Best Practices
- **Downtime management:** Players should be engaged even when it's not their turn
- **Meaningful conflict:** Interactions should serve strategic purposes
- **Variable interaction:** Different games should have different levels of conflict
- **Reactive play:** Players should be able to respond to others' actions
- **Shared systems:** Common resources, markets, or boards create natural interaction
- **Endgame engagement:** All players should feel they can influence the outcome until the end

## Satisfaction (Feedback & Accomplishment)

| Dimension | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Signals** | Tactile component quality, visual progression, scoring clarity, milestone achievements |
| **Rules** | How progress is tracked, when victory becomes visible, tension escalation |
| **Knobs** | Component quality, scoring granularity, victory point visibility, endgame trigger clarity |
| **Acceptance Test** | Do players feel a sense of accomplishment when scoring? Is winning satisfying beyond just "I won"? |

### Satisfaction Red Flags
- Winning feels random or unearned
- No feedback until final scoring
- Invisible progress (surprise victories)
- Components feel cheap or fragile
- Anti-climactic endings
- Score tracking is tedious or error-prone

### Satisfaction Best Practices
- **Visible progress:** Players should see how close they are to winning
- **Tactile quality:** Components should feel good to handle
- **Clear milestones:** Small victories build toward the final win
- **Climactic endings:** Final turns should feel tense and meaningful
- **Multiple victory paths:** Different strategies should feel equally satisfying
- **Scoring transparency:** Players should understand why they won/lost

## Fit (Theme-Mechanic Integration)

| Dimension | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Signals** | Mechanics that embody the theme, art style consistency, narrative integration, component theming |
| **Rules** | How theme emerges from mechanics (not pasted on), thematic constraints, narrative arcs |
| **Knobs** | Art style, component design, terminology, iconography, rulebook flavor text |
| **Acceptance Test** | Does the game tell the story it intends to? Would changing the theme require changing mechanics? |

### Fit Red Flags
- Theme is "pasted on" (mechanics work with any theme)
- Mechanics contradict the theme (e.g., trading in a survival horror game)
- Art style is inconsistent
- Terminology breaks immersion (technical terms in a fantasy game)
- Components don't match the setting
- Theme interferes with clarity

### Fit Best Practices
- **Integrated mechanics:** The theme should emerge naturally from gameplay
- **Consistent art:** Single art style throughout all components
- **Thematic terminology:** Use language that fits the setting
- **Narrative structure:** Beginning, middle, and end should tell a story
- **Component theming:** Physical pieces should represent what they are in the game world
- **Example:** In a trading game in a port city, the mechanics of negotiation, supply/demand, and routes should feel like running a merchant business

## Priority Resolution

When components conflict, resolve in this order:

1. **Clarity** - Players must understand the game to play it
2. **Strategy** - Players must have meaningful decisions
3. **Interaction** - Players should engage with each other
4. **Satisfaction** - Players should feel rewarded
5. **Fit** - Theme should serve the gameplay

Example: If making a game more "thematic" (Fit) would make the rules confusing (Clarity), prioritize Clarity. Find thematic integration through art and terminology instead.

## Component-S Evaluation Matrix

Use this matrix to rate each component on a scale of 1-5:

| Component | 1 (Critical Issue) | 3 (Adequate) | 5 (Excellent) |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Clarity | Rules are confusing/contradictory | Rules are understandable but require reference | Rules are clear and intuitive |
| Strategy | No meaningful decisions | Some strategic choices | Rich, varied strategic paths |
| Interaction | Multiplayer solitaire or elimination | Occasional interaction | Constant meaningful engagement |
| Satisfaction | Winning feels random/empty | Some sense of accomplishment | Strong emotional payoff |
| Fit | Theme pasted on or contradictory | Theme works adequately | Theme emerges from mechanics |

**Passing threshold:** Minimum 3 in all components, with at least one component at 4+.
