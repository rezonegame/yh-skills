# Playtesting Questions Framework

Based on Joe Slack's "The Board Game Design Course" and Sen-Foong Lim's famous question.

## The Magic Question (Sen-Foong Lim)

**"If you played this game again, and just one thing was different that made you think the game had improved, even only by 5%... what would be different?"**

This single question often reveals the biggest pain point players experienced.

## Universal Questions (All Stages)

### Core Experience
- What was the most fun part of the game?
- What was the least fun part of the game?
- Did the game feel like it had the right length for this type of game?
- Would you play it again?

### Agency & Control
- (To the winner) Do you feel like you deserved to win?
- (To non-winners) Do you feel like you stood a chance of winning?
- Were you engaged right until the end?
- If you played it again, would you do anything differently? If so, what?

### Unmet Desires
- Were there things you wanted to do in the game, but couldn't? If so, what?
- Did you feel like you had meaningful choices throughout?

### Pace & Downtime
- Were the turns a good length?
- Did you find yourself waiting too long between your turns?

## Early Stage Questions (Concept Validation)

### Core Concept
- Did the idea for the game make sense?
- Does the idea have potential?
- Would you like to see where the game goes next?

### Differentiation
- What other games does this remind you of?
- What makes this game unique or different?

## Late Stage Questions (Polish)

### Rules Clarity
- Was there anything in the rulebook that needs to be more clear?
- Were there any rules you had to look up repeatedly?
- Did any rules feel contradictory or confusing?

### Completeness
- Does this feel like a fairly complete game to you?
- Is there anything that feels missing or underdeveloped?

### Market Viability
- Is this a game you would buy?
- What do you think you'd pay for this game?
- Who do you think would enjoy this game most?

## Cooperative Game Specific Questions

### Pressure & Urgency
- Did you feel there were more things you needed to do than you could handle?
- Did you have a constant or nearly constant feeling of urgency?
- Did the pressure escalate appropriately throughout the game?

### Player Roles
- Did you feel your unique player powers were helpful or interesting?
- Did you feel your role mattered to the team's success?
- How did you feel about the way your characters all worked together?

### Quarterbacking
- Were there any issues of one player taking over or quarterbacking?
- Did everyone feel they could contribute meaningfully?
- Did anyone feel like they were just watching others play?

### Differentiation
- Was this different enough from other co-op games you've played to make it interesting?

## Observation Guidelines

### Body Language to Watch For
- **Engagement:** Are players leaning forward or leaning back?
- **Confusion:** Furrowed brows, re-reading cards, asking clarifying questions
- **Boredom:** Looking around, checking phone, disengaged posture
- **Excitement:** Smiling, laughing, high-fives, enthusiastic discussion
- **Frustration:** Sighing, tense posture, negative comments
- **Analysis Paralysis:** Staring at options for extended periods

### Timing Notes
- How long does setup take?
- How long is each turn?
- How long is total playtime?
- When do players seem most/least engaged?

### Common Behaviors to Note
- Do players ask "Can I do this?" often?
- Do players reference the rulebook frequently?
- Do players help each other or play independently?
- Do players remember rules between sessions?
- Do players suggest house rules?

## Question Asking Best Practices

### DO:
- Ask open-ended questions
- Ask "why" to understand deeper
- Listen more than you speak
- Take notes while players talk
- Ask follow-up questions to clarify
- Observe body language
- Let players finish their thoughts

### DON'T:
- Defend your design
- Explain what you "meant"
- Lead witnesses by suggesting answers
- Ask "Did you like it?" (too vague)
- Get defensive about criticism
- Interrupt to clarify rules during gameplay
- Take feedback from only one group

---

## The "Why Behind the What"

When players give feedback, focus on **why** they feel that way, not **what** they suggest as a solution.

Example:
- Player: "You should add more cards"
- You: "What makes you feel like there aren't enough cards?"
- Player: "I keep running out of options"
- You: "Is it that you want more choices, or that the cards you draw don't let you do what you want?"
- Player: "I can't ever build the engine I want"
- **Insight:** The issue may not be card count, but card distribution or build cost

## Iteration Tracking

| Version | Date | Key Changes | Feedback | Next Steps |
|---------|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| v0.1 | | | | |
| v0.2 | | | | |
| v0.3 | | | | |

## Remember

**Playtesters are doing you a favor.** They are giving you their time and attention. Be grateful, be humble, and use their feedback wisely.

**You don't have to change everything.** Weigh all criticism and only change what you truly think needs to be changed. Listen more to **why** a playtester feels a certain way and less to their specific suggestions for overhauling your design.

**New eyes are valuable.** Constantly put new eyes on your design. A group that has played your game many times will have very different feedback from a group seeing it for the first time.

**Your customers will be first-time players.** When somebody buys your game, they will be playing it for the first time. What experience will they have?
