## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are farmers raising sheep, pigs, cows, and horses. With three workers, you build stalls, enclose pastures, and upgrade your farm. Stalls can become stables, and your cottage can be upgraded into a half-timbered house. The winner is the player who scores the most victory points by raising animals and constructing valuable buildings.  

The game ends after the 8th round. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player who was not the starting player wins.

2. Give each player a Farm Board, oriented with forest at the top and path at the bottom.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of the 8 rounds consists of four phases:  

#### Phase 1: Refill Phase  
- Refill all action spaces with a brown refill arrow.  
  - If space is empty: place Good 1 (e.g., 1 reed).  
  - If space has goods: place Good 2 (e.g., 1 sheep).  
- For "Good 1/Good 2" spaces, only one good is added per round.  
- Add 1 yellow Border to the "Expand" space to mark the round.  
- (Through the Seasons – Autumn) Each resource-generating action space produces 1 extra resource when refilled.  

#### Phase 2: Work Phase  
- Starting with the start player, players alternate placing one worker on an unoccupied action space.  
- Each player places all 3 workers.  
- When placing a worker:  
  - Take all goods on the space.  
  - Perform the action described.  
  - If using an expansion tile, follow its modified rules.  
- A space cannot be used twice in one round.  
- You must be able to perform the action to use a space.  

#### Phase 3: Home Phase  
- All workers return to their respective farms.  

#### Phase 4: Breeding Phase  
- For each animal type, if you have at least two, gain one additional animal of that type.  
- (Through the Seasons – Spring) One animal type breeds two instead of one (player’s choice).  
- (Through the Seasons – Winter) No animals breed.  
- Newborn animals that cannot be placed run away (return to supply).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Spaces (Base & Expansion Rules)  
- **Start Player and 1 Wood**:  
  - Take all wood, OR if this is your 1st or 2nd worker this turn, take the start player marker and replay this worker at the end of the Work Phase.  
- **3 Wood**:  
  - Take 3 wood.  
  - (Expansion) You may only move a border already on your farm.  
- **1 Stone**:  
  - Take all stone and/or wood on space.  
  - (Expansion) Start player adds 1 stone or 1 wood during Refill Phase.  
- **2 Stone**:  
  - Take all stone, OR in round 8, add 1 point to final score (worker serves no other purpose).  
- **Fences**:  
  - Gain wood equal to the number of fences sold. Wood may be used immediately to place borders. Sold fences are removed.  
- **Walls**:  
  - Add 2 borders to your farm. Then, pay 3 stone per batch of 2 additional borders. After, you may flip one Special Building (not Cottage, Stall, or Stable) to convert it into a size-1 pasture (loses all abilities and points).  
- **Building Materials**:  
  - Take all reeds, then take either 2 wood or 1 stone. (Note: Reeds are limited; substitute tokens may be needed.)  
- **Stalls**:  
  - Must build one Stall (3 stone + 1 reed). If you have exactly 3 animals (any type), pay 1 wood to trigger an immediate personal breeding phase.  
- **Feeding Trough**:  
  - Add 1 feeding trough for free. Add more at cost of 2 wood + 1 stone each. Then, optionally place 2 wood under one trough (permanent; cannot be used again). This trough now allows its space (pasture, stall, stable) to hold two animal types. Max 2 wood per trough.  
- **Stables**:  
  - Upgrade Stall to Stable costs 3 wood + 3 stone (instead of 5 wood or 5 stone).  
- **Special Building**:  
  - Reduce cost of one Special Building by 1 wood or 1 stone. Opponent gains that resource. You may use this benefit a second time (once per player).  
- **Millpond**:  
  - Refill sequence:  
    - Round 1: Add 1 reed (if empty)  
    - Round 2: Add 1 sheep (if reed present)  
    - Round 3: Remove reed, add 2 sheep (total: 3 sheep)  
    - Subsequent rounds: Add 2 sheep  
  - Taking the action removes all sheep.  

#### Keeping Animals  
- **Pastures**: Must be fully enclosed (walls, fences, or building edges). Each pasture space holds 2 animals. Only one animal type per pasture.  
- **Buildings**:  
  - Cottage: 1 animal  
  - Half-Timbered House: 2 animals (same type)  
  - Stall: 3 animals (same type)  
  - Stable: 5 animals (same type)  
  - Open Stable (Special Building): 5 animals + free cow or horse  
  - Other Special Buildings: Capacity shown on tile  
- **Feeding Troughs**:  
  - Double capacity of a space (pasture or building).  
  - Can be placed on cottage.  
  - Max one trough per space, but multiple troughs allowed in multi-space pastures.  
  - Trough on unenclosed space holds 1 animal.  
  - Troughs can be under buildings or pastures.  

#### Through the Seasons Expansion  
- Season marker advances each round.  
- **Spring**: One animal type breeds 2 instead of 1. Action: gain 2 feeding troughs.  
- **Summer**: All buildings cost 1 less resource. Action: gain 2 animals and 1 building material.  
- **Autumn**: Resource actions produce 1 extra resource. Action: gain 1 of each material + 1 of your choice.  
- **Winter**: No breeding. Action: move or place 2 fences already on farm.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Round 8. Final scoring:  

1. **Animals**: 1 point per animal.  
2. **Animal Bonus Points**:  
   - Based on number of each animal type:  
     - 1 animal: 1 point  
     - 2: 3  
     - 3: 6  
     - 4: 8  
     - 5: 10  
     - 6: 12  
     - Each additional animal: +1 point  
   - Score for each animal type separately.  
3. **Farm Expansions**:  
   - Each expansion board with all 3 spaces used = 4 points  
   - A space is used if it has:  
     - A building  
     - A feeding trough  
     - Part of a fully enclosed pasture  
   - Unused or partially enclosed pastures do not count.  
   - Unused expansion boards score 0.  
4. **Buildings**:  
   - Stalls, Stables, Special Buildings: score points shown on tile.  
   - Storage Building: scores based on building materials in supply:  
     - 1–2: 1 point  
     - 3–4: 2  
     - 5–7: 3  
     - 8–10: 4  
     - 11+: 5  

Total all points. Highest score wins. Tiebreaker: non-starting player wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a building on a feeding trough?**  
  Yes. The trough goes into the building and doubles its capacity.  
- **Can I upgrade a stall with a feeding trough to a stable?**  
  Yes. The trough remains and doubles the stable’s capacity (5 → 10).  
- **Can I have multiple animal types in a pasture?**  
  Only if a feeding trough with 2 wood underneath is present.  
- **Can I use wood from selling fences immediately?**  
  Yes.  
- **Can I use the Start Player action if I’m not first or second worker?**  
  No. Only if it’s your 1st or 2nd worker placement.  
- **Can I use the Special Building cost reduction more than once?**  
  Yes, but only once per player (max 2 uses total).  
- **What happens if I can’t place newborn animals?**  
  They run away (return to supply).  
- **Can I rearrange animals anytime?**  
  Yes.  
- **Can I release animals back to supply?**  
  Yes, at any time.
