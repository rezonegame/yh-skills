## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
In *RA*, players are Egyptian pharaohs competing to build the most advanced and prosperous civilization over three epochs. The goal is to accumulate the most Victory Points (VP) by acquiring and strategically using tiles representing monuments, gods, gold, pharaohs, and other aspects of ancient Egyptian society. The game ends after three epochs, and the player with the highest VP total wins, with ties broken by the highest-numbered Sun Disk.

3. **Setup**  
1. Place the Auction Board with the Sun Boat icon side up.  
2. Place the Ra Statue and Scoring Tokens near the board.  
3. Place the Sun Boat Marker on the Ra Track starting space corresponding to player count (2–5 players).  
4. Place the Epoch Counter on the upper right of the Ra Track, First Epoch side up.  
5. Place Sun Disk #1 on the Auction Board’s center space.  
6. Shuffle all Auction Tiles into the cloth bag.  
7. Each player:  
   - Takes one Player Board (correct side up for player count).  
   - Receives one random set of Sun Disks (based on player count).  
   - Places those Sun Disks faceup on matching blue ovals on their board.  
   - Takes two face-down 5-point Scoring Tokens (total 10 VP start).  
8. The player with the highest-numbered Sun Disk takes the Ra Statue and starts the first Epoch.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
- The game is played over **3 Epochs**.  
- Each Epoch consists of turns taken clockwise, starting with the player holding the Ra Statue.  
- On a player’s turn, they must take one of three actions:  
  1. **Draw a Tile** (only if Auction Track is not full)  
  2. **Spend God Tile(s)**  
  3. **Invoke Ra**  
- A player with no faceup Sun Disks cannot act and is skipped.  
- The Epoch ends when:  
  - All players have no faceup Sun Disks, **or**  
  - The Sun Boat reaches the final space of the Ra Track (triggered by drawing a Ra Tile).  
- After each Epoch, scoring occurs, tiles are discarded as needed, and the next Epoch begins.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
**Draw a Tile**  
- Draw one tile from the bag.  
- If it’s **not a Ra Tile**: Place it in the leftmost empty space on the Auction Track.  
- If it’s a **Ra Tile**:  
  - Discard it.  
  - Advance the Sun Boat one space right on the Ra Track.  
  - If the Sun Boat lands on the final space, the Epoch ends immediately (no auction).  
  - Otherwise, the player takes the Ra Statue and begins an auction.  

**Spend God Tile(s)**  
- Discard any number of your God Tiles.  
- For each God Tile discarded, take one non-God, non-Ra Tile from the Auction Track.  
- If a Disaster Tile is acquired this way, resolve its effect immediately.  
- Gaps on the Auction Track are filled left-to-right in future draws.  

**Invoke Ra**  
- Say “I invoke Ra!” and take the Ra Statue.  
- Begin an auction.  
- If the Auction Track is full, you may only Invoke Ra or Spend God Tiles.  

**Auctions**  
- Triggered by:  
  - Drawing a Ra Tile (not on final Ra Track space), or  
  - A player Invoking Ra.  
- The triggering player is the **Ra Player**.  
- Bidding starts with the player to the left of the Ra Player, proceeds clockwise.  
- Each player may:  
  - Bid one faceup Sun Disk (value must exceed previous bid), or  
  - Pass (only once).  
- The Ra Player bids last.  
- Auction outcomes depend on trigger:  
  - **Ra Tile drawn**: If all pass, tiles and center Sun remain.  
  - **Ra invoked, Auction Track full**: If all pass, all Auction Track tiles are discarded.  
  - **Ra invoked, Auction Track not full**: All except Ra Player may pass. Ra Player **must bid** if all others pass.  
- **Auction Winner**:  
  - Takes all tiles from the Auction Track.  
  - Swaps their winning Sun Disk with the center Sun Disk (winner places center Sun face down on their board; winning Sun goes face up to center).  
  - Other bidders return their Sun Disks faceup to their boards.  
- After auction, play continues clockwise from the Ra Player.

**Disaster Tiles**  
- Triggered when acquired via auction or God Tile use.  
- Must discard 2 matching tiles of the affected type:  
  - **Unrest (War)**: Civilization Tiles  
  - **Funeral**: Pharaoh Tiles  
  - **Drought**: Flood Tiles first, then Nile Tiles  
  - **Earthquake**: Monument Tiles  
- If insufficient matching tiles, discard as many as possible.  
- After resolution, discard the Disaster Tile.  
- Flood Tiles are discarded after each Epoch.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
**After 1st and 2nd Epochs:**  
1. Score tiles as below.

   - Gold Tiles

3. Return Sun Boat to starting space (by player count).  
4. Flip Epoch Counter (1st → 2nd); discard it after 2nd Epoch.  
5. All players flip their Sun Disks faceup.  
6. Player with highest-numbered faceup Sun Disk starts next Epoch.
