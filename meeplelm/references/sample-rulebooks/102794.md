3. Setup  
- Each player chooses a color, takes 5 Dwarf discs, 3 Stables, a home board, and 2 overview cards.  
- Place 2 Dwarfs in the Entry-level Dwelling; others go to supply.  
- Randomly determine starting player; distribute starting food:

- Shuffle 7 Harvest markers face-down; place one under each round space from 6 to 12.  
- Stock Furnishing supply boards according to game variant (Introductory or Full).  
- Place general supplies (resources, animals, tiles) within reach.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has five phases:  
1. **Add Action Space & Harvest Marker**: Reveal top Action card and place in next round slot. From Round 6 onward, flip the Harvest marker.  
2. **Replenish Accumulating Spaces**: Add resources to spaces with arrows:  
   - If space is empty, use bold number.  
   - If occupied, use number in parentheses.  
3. **Work Phase**: Starting with first player, players take turns placing one Dwarf on an unoccupied Action space and immediately taking the action.  
   - Dwarfs must be played in ascending Weapon Strength order (unarmed first).  
   - A player may spend 1 Ruby to play a Dwarf out of order.  
   - Action spaces may be “either/or”, “and/or”, or “and then/or”; players must perform at least one action.  
   - Play continues clockwise until all Dwarfs are placed.  
4. **Return Home**: All Dwarfs return to Dwellings on players’ boards.  
5. **Harvest Time** (if triggered):  
   - **Field Phase**: Remove 1 Grain or Vegetable from each sown Field; place in personal supply.  
   - **Feeding Phase**: Pay 2 Food per Dwarf. Newborn Dwarfs (from current round) require only 1 Food.  
     - Convert goods to Food as needed using conversion chart.  
     - Take 1 Begging marker per missing Food.  
   - **Breeding Phase**: For each animal type with ≥2 adults, gain 1 newborn if space is available.  
     - Dogs do not breed.  
     - Max 1 newborn per animal type.  

Harvest types:  
- Rounds 3 and 5: Full Harvest  
- Round 4: Pay 1 Food per Dwarf only (no Field or Breeding)  
- Rounds 6–12: Determined by Harvest marker:  
  - Green Leaf: Full Harvest  
  - 1st Red ?: No Harvest  
  - 2nd Red ?: Pay 1 Food per Dwarf  
  - 3rd Red ?: Full Harvest, but skip either Field or Breeding phase (player’s choice)

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Weapons & Expeditions**:  
  - Unarmed Dwarf can forge a weapon by spending 1–8 Ore (strength = Ore spent).  
  - Armed Dwarfs can undertake Expeditions.  
  - Expedition level (1–4) determines number of loot items taken.  
  - Loot must be at or below Dwarf’s current weapon strength.  
  - After Expedition, Dwarf’s weapon strength increases by 1 (max 14).  
  - Loot types: Gain resources, animals, tiles, build stables/pastures, sow crops, breed animals, furnish caverns.  
  - Special loot: “All Weapons +1” increases all armed Dwarfs’ strength by 1.  
- **Ruby Trading**: At any time, spend 1 Ruby to:  
  - Gain 1 Wood, Stone, Ore, Dog, Sheep, Donkey, Boar, Grain, Vegetable, Field, Meadow, Tunnel, or Cavern.  
  - Spend 1 Ruby + 1 Food to gain 1 Cattle.  
  - Spend 2 Rubies to gain 1 Cavern.  
  - Spend 1 Ruby to play a Dwarf out of order.  
- **Landscape Tiles**:  
  - Must be placed adjacent to existing network (cave entrance for surface, mountain tiles for tunnels).  
  - First tile must be adjacent to cave entrance.  
  - Twin tiles cover two spaces; single tiles cover one.  
- **Furnishings**:  
  - Place on empty Cavern spaces. Pay cost in materials.  
  - Dwellings provide space for additional Dwarfs (family growth).  
  - Only ordinary Dwellings are unlimited.  
- **Family Growth**:  
  - Requires available Dwelling space.  
  - Gain 1 Dwarf (max 5; 6 only with Additional Dwelling).  
  - Newborn Dwarf cannot act until next round.  
- **Animal Husbandry**:  
  - Breeding: ≥2 adults of same type + space for newborn → gain 1.  
  - Placement rules:  
    - Small Pasture: 2 animals  
    - Large Pasture: 4 animals  
    - Stable doubles capacity  
    - Two stables on Large Pasture: 16 animals  
    - Stable on Forest: 1 Wild boar  
    - Stable on Meadow: 1 animal  
    - Each mine (Ore/Ruby): 1 Donkey  
    - Entry-level Dwelling: 2 animals  
    - Dogs: Anywhere; allow +1 Sheep per Dog on Meadow/Pasture (stable and dog cannot coexist on same space for sheep)  
- **Mines**:  
  - Ore Mine: Place over two adjacent Tunnel tiles; gain 3 Ore.  
  - Ruby Mine: Place on Tunnel or Deep Tunnel; gain 1 Ruby if on Deep Tunnel.  
  - Each mine scores points and holds 1 Donkey.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Round 12. Score Gold Points as follows:  
- **Positive**:  
  - 1 Gold per Farm animal and Dog  
  - ½ Gold per Grain (rounded up)  
  - 1 Gold per Vegetable  
  - 1 Gold per Ruby  
  - 1 Gold per Dwarf  
  - 2 Gold per Small Pasture, 4 Gold per Large Pasture  
  - 3 Gold per Ore Mine, 4 Gold per Ruby Mine  
  - Points from Furnishing tiles (as printed)  
  - Gold coins (face value)  
- **Negative**:  
  - -2 Gold per missing farm animal type (Sheep, Donkey, Wild boar, Cattle)  
  - -1 Gold per unused space (empty Forest or Mountain space without tile or Stable)  
  - -3 Gold per Begging marker  
- Bonus scoring from Furnishings (e.g., Fodder chamber, Parlors, Storages) applies as described on tiles.  
- Highest score wins. Ties result in shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you block an action without using it?** No. You must be able to perform at least one action to place a Dwarf.  
- **Can you convert animals gained from actions?** Yes, immediately upon receipt if no space.  
- **Breeding with no space?** No. Breeding requires space; otherwise, no animal is gained.  
- **Ruby trading during actions?** Yes, at any time, including mid-action (e.g., gain wood via loot, then use it to build).  
- **Multiple actions on same turn?** No. One Dwarf per turn.  
- **Dwarf with no space?** Cannot grow family without Dwelling space.  
- **Expedition loot order?** Loot is resolved sequentially; earlier loot can enable later loot (e.g., gain wood, then build).  
- **Guest Room effect?** Converts “either/or” actions to “and/or”, allowing both options in any order.  
- **Starting Player**: Not passed automatically; must be taken via action. Accumulates Food and 2 Ore (or 1 Ruby in 4–7 player games).  
- **Imitation Action**: Pay Food cost to copy another player’s occupied action (except Starting Player). Does not gain accumulating goods.  
- **2-Player Game**: 11 rounds; no Exploration card; no Harvest marker on Round 9; Ruby Mining accumulates from Round 3.
