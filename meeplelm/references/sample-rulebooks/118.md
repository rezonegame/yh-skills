## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players are art dealers competing to earn the most money over four rounds by strategically auctioning and collecting paintings. The player with the highest cash total at the end of the fourth round wins. In case of a tie, all tied players share victory.

2. **Components**  
- 70 painting cards from 5 artists:  
  - Rafael Silveira (16 cards)  
  - Ramon Martins (15 cards)  
  - Daniel Melin (14 cards)  
  - Sigrid Thaler (13 cards)  
  - Manuel Carvalho (12 cards)  
- Money: Each player starts with $100 (denominations: $50×1, $20×1, $10×2, $5×1, $1×5)  
- 5 Museum screens (to hide money)  
- Auction hammer token  
- Artist Value tiles: $30, $20, $10 (used per round)  
- Game board showing artists in left-to-right order (used for tiebreakers)

3. **Setup**  
- Shuffle all 70 painting cards.  
- Deal cards based on player count:  
  - 3 players: 10 cards each  
  - 4 players: 9 cards each  
  - 5 players: 8 cards each  
- Each player receives a Museum screen and $100. Money must be hidden behind the screen.  
- Determine starting player (commonly the youngest). They take the auction hammer and become the first Auctioneer.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
- On their turn, the Auctioneer selects one painting from their hand and places it face-up.  
- An auction is conducted based on the symbol on the card.  
- The winner pays the Auctioneer (or the bank if the Auctioneer wins) and places the painting face-up in front of their screen.  
- The auction hammer passes to the next player to the left, who becomes the new Auctioneer.  
- Play continues until the round ends.  
- After round settlement, a new round begins with the player to the left of the player who played the final card.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
**Auction Types:**  
- **Open Auction (+):**  
  - Players may bid in any order, multiple times.  
  - Bids must exceed the previous highest bid.  
  - Highest bidder wins.  
- **Once-Around Auction (<C>):**  
  - Bidding proceeds clockwise, starting with the player to the left of the Auctioneer.  
  - Each player may bid once or pass.  
  - Auctioneer has the final bid.  
  - Highest bidder wins.  
- **Hidden Auction (o):**  
  - All players secretly place a bid (including $0) in their fist.  
  - Bids are revealed simultaneously.  
  - Highest bid wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: the player closest to the Auctioneer in clockwise order wins (Auctioneer wins ties).  
- **Fixed Price Auction ({}):**  
  - Auctioneer announces a price.  
  - Going clockwise from the player to their left, each player may accept or pass.  
  - First player to accept wins the painting.  
  - If all pass, Auctioneer must buy it at the stated price.  
  - Auctioneer cannot set a price higher than their available cash.  
- **Double Auction (==):**  
  - Auctioneer may play a second painting by the same artist (not another Double card).  
  - The auction type is determined by the second painting.  
  - Winner receives both paintings and pays the full bid amount.  
  - Proceeds go entirely to the player who provides the second painting (they become the new Auctioneer).  
  - If Auctioneer cannot or chooses not to provide a second painting, the option passes clockwise.  
  - First player to provide a second painting runs the auction and collects all money.  
  - If no player provides a second painting, the original Auctioneer takes the first painting for free.  
  - Play resumes with the player to the left of the new Auctioneer (or original Auctioneer if no second painting was added).

**General Auction Rules:**  
- All bids must be in $1 increments.  
- Bids must exceed the previous bid (except in Fixed Price).  
- Players cannot bid more than their current cash.  
- If no one bids (except in Fixed Price), the Auctioneer takes the painting for free.  
- The Auctioneer pays the bank if they win a painting.  
- Paintings won are placed face-up in front of the player, not in hand.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **Round End:**  
  - A round ends immediately when the 5th painting by any artist is played.  
  - The 5th painting is **not auctioned** and is not owned by any player.  
  - Exception: If a Double Auction would result in the 4th and 5th paintings being played, **neither is auctioned**.  
- **Ranking Artists:**  
  - Count total paintings played for each artist (including unsold ones).  
  - Assign value tiles:  
    - 1st place: $30  
    - 2nd place: $20  
    - 3rd place: $10  
    - 4th and 5th: no value this round  
  - Tiebreaker: the artist furthest to the left on the board wins the higher position.  
- **Selling Paintings:**  
  - Players sell all paintings they own from the top 3 artists.  
  - Value per painting = sum of all value tiles in that artist’s column (current + previous rounds).  
  - Paintings from artists not in the top 3 this round are worthless, even if they had prior value.  
  - All sold and unsold paintings are discarded.  
- **New Round Setup:**  
  - Players keep remaining cards in hand.  
  - Deal additional cards:  
    - 3 players: +6 cards  
    - 4 players: +4 cards  
    - 5 players: +3 cards  
  - Next round starts with the player to the left of the one who played the final card.

**Game End:**  
- The game ends after the 4th round.  
- After final settlement, players count total cash.  
- Highest cash total wins. Ties result in shared victory.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Player runs out of cards:**  
  - Cannot start auctions but may still bid.  
  - Misses auctioneer turns until new cards are dealt.  
- **All players run out of cards before 5th painting:**  
  - Round ends when the last card is played.  
  - No auction for the last card.  
  - It counts toward artist totals.  
  - Final settlement occurs as normal. Game ends.  
- **Double Auction with 5th painting:**  
  - If the first card of a Double would be the 5th, the round ends. No second card is played.  
  - If the second card would be the 5th, both cards are unsold and do not count toward any player’s collection.  
- **Tie in bids (Hidden Auction):**  
  - Winner is the player closest to the Auctioneer in clockwise order (Auctioneer wins if tied).  
- **Starting player for next round:**  
  - Always the player to the left of the one who played the final card of the previous round.
