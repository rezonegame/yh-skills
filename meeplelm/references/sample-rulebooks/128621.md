## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Viticulture is a worker-placement strategy game set in old-world Tuscany where players take on the role of vineyard owners. The goal is to build the most reputable winery by planting vines, harvesting grapes, making wine, and fulfilling wine orders to earn victory points (VP). The first player to reach 20 VP triggers the end of the game, which concludes at the end of that year. The player with the most VP wins.

### 2. Components
- Game board (double-sided: beginner and expert)
- 6 vineyard mats (double-sided)
- 42 vine cards (green deck)
- 36 wine order cards (purple deck)
- 20 summer visitor cards (yellow deck)
- 20 winter visitor cards (blue deck)
- 36 worker meeples (6 colors + 1 gray temporary worker)
- 6 grande worker meeples
- 60 clear glass grape and wine tokens
- 6 wake-up tokens (roosters)
- 6 victory point tokens (corks)
- 6 residual payment tracker tokens (wine bottles)
- 48 wooden structure tokens (8 per player color)
- 108 lira coins (78×€1, 18×€2, 12×€5)
- 1 first-player token (green grapes)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the game board in the center. Shuffle and place each deck (vine, wine order, summer visitor, winter visitor) on their designated spots.
2. Each player takes:
   - One vineyard mat
   - All tokens of one color (workers, structure tokens)
   - 3 starting workers (including 1 grande worker)
   - 1 pinot vine card (set aside one per player from the deck and distribute)
   - 1 random summer visitor card
   - €3
3. Each player places:
   - Rooster token above the wake-up chart
   - Victory point token on the "Start" space of the VP track
   - Residual payment token on the € symbol (center) of the Residual Payment Tracker
4. Randomly choose the starting player and give them the first-player token.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in yearly cycles, each consisting of five phases:

#### Spring
- Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player places their rooster on an unoccupied row of the wake-up chart (1–7).
- Players gain rewards based on their chosen wake-up time:
  - 1: No bonus
  - 2: Draw 1 vine card
  - 3: Draw 1 wine order card
  - 4: Gain €1
  - 5: Draw 1 summer or winter visitor card
  - 6: Gain 1 VP
  - 7: Gain the temporary worker for the year (acts as a regular worker)
- Turn order for the rest of the year is determined by wake-up position (1 = first, 7 = last).

#### Summer
- Players take turns in wake-up order to place one worker on an available yellow summer action space.
- Actions include:
  - Play One Summer Visitor Card
  - Draw One Vine Card (+ bonus: draw additional)
  - Give a Vineyard Tour (gain €2; + bonus: gain €1)
  - Sell Grapes (gain € based on value; + bonus: gain €1)
  - Plant One Vine (+ bonus: plant additional)
  - Build One Structure (+ bonus: get discount)
- Players may pass at any time by sliding their rooster to the right. Passed players cannot act further in summer.
- The Grande Worker may be placed on an already occupied action (but does not gain the bonus).
- Action availability scales with player count:
  - 2 players: only left space
  - 3–4 players: left and middle (bonus) spaces
  - 5–6 players: all three spaces

#### Fall
- In wake-up order, each player draws one summer or winter visitor card.
- If a player has built the Cottage, they draw two visitor cards (any combination), all at once.

#### Winter
- Same structure as summer, using blue winter action spaces:
  - Play One Winter Visitor Card
  - Draw One Wine Order Card (+ bonus: draw additional)
  - Harvest One Field (+ bonus: harvest additional)
  - Gain €1 ("Gain for Help")
  - Train a New Worker (costs €1; + bonus: €1 discount)
  - Make Wine (up to two wine tokens; + bonus: make one extra)
  - Fill One Wine Order (+ bonus: gain 1 VP)
- The Yoke structure allows a player to use a private action (Uproot or Harvest) once per year by placing a worker on their mat.
- Players pass by sliding roosters to the left.

#### Year End
1. **Age Grape and Wine Tokens**: Increase all grape and wine token values by 1.
   - Wines above value 3 require a Medium Cellar.
   - Wines above value 6 require a Large Cellar.
   - Tokens at value 9 do not age.
2. **Return All Workers**: Retrieve all workers (including trained and temporary).
3. **Collect Residual Payments**: Gain € equal to position on Residual Payment Tracker (max €5).
4. **Discard Down to 7 Cards**: Players discard down to 7 cards in hand.
5. **Rotate First Player**: Pass the first-player token counterclockwise.
6. **Reset Wake-up Tokens**: Remove roosters from the wake-up chart.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Worker Placement
- Each worker may be used only once per year.
- Workers may only be placed on current season’s action spaces.
- A player must be able to complete the action to take it.
- Passing removes a player from the current season.
- The **Grande Worker** can occupy an already full action space but does not receive the bonus.

#### Structures
- **Trellis (€2)**: Required to plant vines with trellis symbol.
- **Irrigation (€2)**: Required to plant vines with irrigation symbol.
- **Windmill (€5)**: Gain 1 VP when planting a vine (max 1 VP/year).
- **Tasting Room (€6)**: Gain 1 VP when giving a vineyard tour (max 1 VP/year).
- **Cottage (€4)**: Draw an extra visitor card in fall.
- **Yoke (€2)**: Allows Uproot (summer) or Harvest One Field (winter) once per year.
- **Medium Cellar (€4)**: Required for blush wines and wines of value 4–6.
- **Large Cellar**: Required for sparkling wines and wines of value 7–9; must have Medium Cellar first.

#### Harvesting a Field
- Use "Harvest One Field" action.
- Add red grape values → one red grape token on crush pad.
- Add white grape values → one white grape token on crush pad.
- Devalue if needed (see below).
- Vines stay on field; field cannot be harvested again this year.

#### Making Wine
- Use "Make Wine" action to convert up to two grape tokens into wine.
- **Red/White Wine**: Move grape token to same value in cellar.
- **Blush (requires Medium Cellar)**: Combine 1 red + 1 white grape (sum ≥ 4).
- **Sparkling (requires Large Cellar)**: Combine 2 red + 1 white grape (sum ≥ 7).
- Discard excess tokens.
- Devalue if no cellar space available.

#### Devaluing
- If a grape or wine token cannot be placed at its value (space occupied or cellar not built), place it at the next lowest available value.
- If no lower space exists, the token is lost.

#### Filling Wine Orders
- Discard one wine order card if you can fulfill all wine requirements (same or higher value).
- Remove required wine tokens from cellar.
- Gain VP and increase residual payment token by € amount (max €5).
- Do not collect € immediately.

#### Visitor Cards
- Played by placing a worker on the "Play Visitor Card" action.
- Effects are immediate and one-time.
- Must be able to fully resolve the card to play it.
- Examples:
  - Buyer (Summer): Sell grapes at double price, gain 1 VP.
  - Marketer (Winter): Fill an order and gain 1 extra VP.
  - Professor (Winter): Train a worker for €3, usable this year.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: When any player reaches or exceeds 20 VP, finish the current year. The player with the most VP wins.
- **VP Cap**: No player may exceed 25 VP.
- **VP Floor**: VP cannot go below -5. Actions that would reduce VP below -5 are invalid.
- **Tiebreakers** (in order):
  1. Most lira (€)
  2. Highest total wine value in cellar
  3. Highest total grape value on crush pad

#### Residual Payments
- Track on Residual Payment Tracker.
- Increases when filling wine orders (€ amount listed).
- Max level: €5.
- Paid at year end (€ equal to tracker level).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I block an action with a regular worker?** No. Players must be able to complete an action to take it.
- **Can the Grande Worker take a bonus?** No, if placed on a full space.
- **Can I use the Yoke more than once per year?** No. Only once, either in summer or winter.
- **What happens if I can’t age a wine?** It stays at its current value.
- **Can I combine grape tokens?** No. Each grape is processed individually unless making blush/sparkling.
- **Can I use higher-value wine to fill an order?** Yes, but the excess value is lost.
- **Can I discard down during the year?** No. Only at year end.
- **What if a deck runs out?** Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck. If no discards exist, the deck is unavailable until cards are discarded.
